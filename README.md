# Jake's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website at <https://jnichols-dev.com>. It acts as a frontend for most of the larger projects I work on, and generally represents my web development skills.

## Tech Stack

jnichols-dev is built on NextJS 13, and primarily uses Tailwind with the DaisyUI plugin for styling. The website is hosted on AWS Amplify, which current is set to auto-deploy the main branch.

## Other Components

- The [blog](https://jnichols-dev.com/blog) is built on a custom blogging engine you can find the source code for over [here](https://github.com/jakenichols2719/jnichols-dev-blog). There's also a blog post detailing the cloud infrastructure, which may be a little more representative of how it works.
